"""
Single-family home valuation — sales comparison approach (how appraisers value houses).

Each comparable sale is adjusted toward the subject home:
  "If this comp were exactly like the owner's house, what would it have sold for?"
Then the adjusted prices are weighted — comps needing smaller adjustments count more.

Adjustment rates below are RULES OF THUMB, not survey data. They vary by market and price
point; review and tune them with local appraisal knowledge.
